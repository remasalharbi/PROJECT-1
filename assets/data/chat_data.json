  {
    "question": "C++ Variables",
    "answer": "Variables in C++ are used to store data such as integers, characters, and floating-point numbers. You must declare a variable with a specific data type."
  },
  {
    "question": "C++ Syntax",
    "answer": "C++ syntax includes statements ending with semicolons, use of curly braces for code blocks, and type declarations for variables."
  },
  {
    "question": "C++ Functions",
    "answer": "Functions in C++ allow you to group code into reusable blocks. You define a function with a return type, name, and parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Java Variables",
    "answer": "Java variables are containers that store data values. Each variable must be declared with a type, such as int, String, or boolean."
  },
  {
    "question": "Java Functions",
    "answer": "Functions in Java are called methods. They are blocks of code that perform a specific task and are defined within classes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Java Syntax",
    "answer": "Java syntax includes class definitions, method declarations, semicolons to end statements, and curly braces to group code blocks."
  },
  {
    "question": "JavaScript Syntax",
    "answer": "JavaScript syntax includes statements ending in semicolons, use of curly braces for blocks, and variable declarations with var, let, or const."
  },
  {
    "question": "JavaScript Functions",
    "answer": "JavaScript functions are blocks of code designed to perform tasks. They can be defined using function keyword or arrow syntax."
  },
  {
    "question": "JS Loops",
    "answer": "JavaScript supports for, while, and do-while loops for repeating a block of code until a certain condition is met."
  },
  {
    "question": "JS Variables",
    "answer": "Variables in JavaScript can be declared using var, let, or const, and are used to store data like numbers or strings."

  {
    "question": "Dart Functions",
    "answer": "Functions in Dart are blocks of code that perform actions. They can be named or anonymous, and support optional parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Dart Loops",
    "answer": "Dart includes for, while, and do-while loops to repeat code blocks. Loops are commonly used for iteration and control flow."
  },
  {
    "question": "Dart Keywords",
    "answer": "Dart has reserved keywords like class, void, if, else, return, which cannot be used as variable names."
  },
  {
    "question": "Python Variables",
    "answer": "In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them. You donâ€™t need to declare a type explicitly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Python Functions",
    "answer": "Python functions are defined using the def keyword and are used to encapsulate code for reuse and modularity."
  },
  {"question": "Python Loops",
